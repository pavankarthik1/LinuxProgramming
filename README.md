In the File "q1.sh" we executed a program to find the errors in the log report which is recorded in /var/log 
In the File "q2.sh" We extracted the errors in a grep file using a loop to read line by line and grep to catch the errors
In the File "q3.sh" we executed q2.sh for every half an hour and write to a file 
Finally, the fourth exercise is monitoring activity we created a process that will execute for a long time 
then we will execute the activity of process to create a process we use "q4.sh" in the file "ex.sh" we grab the process
and its behaviour
